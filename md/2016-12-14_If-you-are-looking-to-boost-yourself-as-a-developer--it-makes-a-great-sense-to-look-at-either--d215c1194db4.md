If you are looking to boost yourself as a developer, it makes a great sense to look at either TypeScript or Flow; **especially** if you don’t have much experience with types beforehand. Dealing with types (and moreover, different type systems) is a distinct developer skill set, and punting on it could hurt one’s long term skill buildup. It’s quite likely that employers will be looking for type-savvy developers more and more in 2017 and beyond. Will probably be a better long term investment than the framework du jour.
