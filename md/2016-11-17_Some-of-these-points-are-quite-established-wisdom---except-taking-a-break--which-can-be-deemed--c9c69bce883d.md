Stick to one platform, framework or language and your professional career will be better on the long run.

Some of these points are quite established wisdom — except taking a break, which can be deemed suspicious. However, this deserves special attention:

> Stick to one platform, framework or language and your professional career will be better on the long run.

To a certain extent, having been “around the block” is important. If you have only experience on one development platform, employers could assume you have a degree of tunnel vision.

Yet nothing is probably more valuable than having a very deep expertise on the platform you are applying to code for. That’s why it’s a very good idea to eventually land on, and stick to a stack you want to develop total mastery of. There are not too many stacks that are safe choices for that right now though — it comes down to .NET, Java, web frontend, iOS and Android.
