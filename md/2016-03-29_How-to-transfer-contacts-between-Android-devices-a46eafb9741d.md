There are various reasons why Google/gmail contacts won’t do the contact transfer “for free” for you — maybe your device has no Google Apps, or whatever.

So here’s what you can do (without involving messy third party apps or cloud services in the process):

*   Go to your contacts application, find Import/Export feature and export all your contacts as .vcf file to local storage
*   Mail the resulting .vcf file to yourself
*   Open the .vcf file in your target phone, in the contacts app. It should be associated with it by default.
