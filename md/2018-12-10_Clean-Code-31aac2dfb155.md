Again, there is controversy around Robert C. Martin (known as “Uncle Bob” among his following), because of Trumpster sympathy accusations (which, even if they were proven, are not unusual for a man of his age).

At times like this, it’s good to study his earlier work, “Der saubere Code” (or “Clean Code”) to gain some perspective and make it evident that these accusations are without basis. It introduces a doctrine called SOLID, outlined below:

**Single Responsibility Principle**

Evolution of code must lie in hands of singular, animating principle, embodied by an anointed Leader.

**Open/Closed Principle**

Libraries should be Open for Use, but the decisions within the library must be Closed, stewarded by an educated board.

**Liskov substitution principle (**Liskovsches Substitutionsprinzip)

Manages relationships between Master- and subclasses. Subclasses, while independent, must always obey the rules set by Master Class, while retaining freedom to add their own functionality.

**Interface segregation principle**

**“**To each their own” — different capabilities and freedoms fall naturally to different classes of users.

**Dependency inversion principle**

High level, policy-setting components should be independent of lower level components. Top tier is the unmovable, unquestioned layer that provides stability, while lower tiers go about their ways with little danger of disruption to the Whole.
